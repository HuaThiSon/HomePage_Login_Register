              <h5>Vacancy Tip:</h5>
              <p>
                Nothing grabs attention better than the promise of a sale,
                discount, or other financial perks, so consider including that
                in your marketing copy headline. Examples include $100 off the
                first monthâ€™s rent, free cable for six months, or a $100 gift
                card upon signing a lease agreement. Although it may seem
                counterintuitive to put up some of your own money or slash rent,
                it is a small price to pay to get the attention of prospective
                tenants and motivate them to choose your rental property over
                another.
